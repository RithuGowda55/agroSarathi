    1. Open-Meteo for weather data
        Hourly Weather Variables
        -Temperature (2 m): Critical for understanding heat conditions.
        -Relative Humidity (2 m): Affects plant transpiration and growth.
        -Precipitation (rain + showers + snow): Indicates moisture availability.
        -Sealevel Pressure: Useful for predicting weather changes.
        -Cloud Cover Total: Impacts sunlight availability.
        -Wind Speed (10 m): Can influence evaporation and physical damage.
        -Soil Moisture (0-1 cm): Directly affects root-level water availability.

        Daily Weather Variables
        -Maximum Temperature (2 m): Useful for tracking heat stress.
        -Minimum Temperature (2 m): Helps track potential frost events.
        -Precipitation Sum: Provides an overall view of moisture conditions.
        -Sunshine Duration: Impacts photosynthesis.
        -UV Index: High levels can affect some plant species.
        -Reference Evapotranspiration (ETâ‚€): Useful for determining water requirements.

        Current Weather
        -Is Day or Night: Influences processes such as photosynthesis.
        -Wind Speed (10 m): Assesses current wind conditions that might affect evaporation and crop stability.
        -Cloud Cover Total: Real-time data impacts solar radiation.
        
        
    2. Agro Monitoring - for soil data 
        get the lat and long then generate the polygon id, then use it to get the soil data (Soil Properties:Calculation Time, Temperature(10 cm depth, K), Soil Moisture(m3/m3), Surface Temperature(K))
